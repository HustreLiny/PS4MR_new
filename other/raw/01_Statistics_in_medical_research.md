# 1 Statistics in medical research

At the thought of statistics, the Collector, walking through the chaotic Residency garden, felt his heart quicken with joy.... For what were statistics but the ordering of a chaotic universe? Statistics were the leg- irons to be clapped on the thugs of ignorance and superstition which strangled Truth in lonely byways.J. G. Farrell, The Siege of Krishnapur

## 1.1 STATISTICS AT LARGE

We are bombarded with statistics to an unprecedented degree. Newspapers contain a wealth of statistical information, relating to trade and industry, finance, (un)employment, road accident figures and the like, and there are frequent results of opinion polls and surveys. Statistics presented in this way are of varying reliability. While political opinion polls are performed with reasonably reliable methods, most surveys are based on asking questions of some convenient group of people, with no concern for their representativeness. They may even be based on volunteered information, as in phone- in polls.

It is also common to see reports of medical research in the media. Research findings are usually based on sound methodology, but as the results may be presented in a like manner the distinction in reliability is not widely perceived. For example, newspapers will report in similar terms the findings of a poll about attitudes to consumption of eggs in the light of worries about salmonella and also the results of an epidemiological study investigating the relation between use of the contraceptive pill and risk of breast cancer. Many medical issues are really too complex to be dealt with adequately in a short item in a newspaper or on television. Topics such as the possibility of raised rates of childhood leukaemia around nuclear power stations or the carcinogenic effect of adding fluoride to drinking water require an in- depth consideration of many complicated issues. The complexity of the fluoride debate may be judged by the fact that a court case lasted 201 days, with much of the evidence being statistical (Oldham, 1985).

The word 'research' has powerful connotations, with reliability being implicit. Few people outside the relevant field are concerned about how the research was done, only about what was found. One recent advertisement I have seen makes use of this weakness. The company supports its promotion of desk top binding systems with the opening comment that 'Research shows that a well presented document stands a  $95\%$  better chance of being properly read and well received'. I doubt whether any such research had been carried out, or even if it could be, but the power of research is successfully invoked.

At the other extreme from this piece of nonsense is the following excerpt from a newspaper report (Guardian, 23 August 1986) of a paper in a medical journal:


> **Score system for heart risk**
>
> A cheap 'ready reckoner' for identifying men at high risk of a heart attack has been devised by doctors it was announced yesterday. Expensive electrocardiograph tests and measurements of blood cholesterol levels can be supplanted by a simple scoring system. The system can identify more than half of the men likely to have a heart attack over the next five years, who can then be advised to adopt a healthier lifestyle or offered treatment. ... The system requires measurement of blood pressure, an estimate of the number of years of cigarette smoking, knowledge of previous angina, heart attack or diabetes, and whether either parent died of heart trouble.

Clearly this study is potentially valuable to thousands of men. Are these results reliable and how was the 'ready reckoner' devised? Of course we would not expect to obtain this information from a short newspaper article, but the fact that no information is given about how the study was performed may put it in no better light than any other statistics reported in the same newspaper.

Another example is given by a newspaper article (Guardian, 19 May 1988) reporting a study of the relation between longevity and left- handedness:


> **Not many old hands left, says scientist**
>
> If you're over 80 and left-handed, you're in a class of your own. Nearly all the other left-handers have passed on... It was, said Dr Halpern last night, a small sample. Generally the scientists found that there was no difference in death rates up till the age of 33; from then the left-handed slowly fade away.
>
> She offered several reasons. One might be that low-weight babies tended to be left-handed, and low birthweight might mean reduced chances of survival. The other was that it was a right-handed world. The left-handed were simply at a disadvantage with automobiles and power tools, suffered from greater stress and had more accidents.

I shall explain in Chapter 5 why the interpretation of the results from this study is not valid. For the moment I shall just note that the study findings are reported uncritically, and the last paragraph contains unsupported speculations which do not even appear in the publication (Halpern and Coren, 1988). There is no way that readers of the newspaper could distinguish the reliability of the information in the two newspaper reports. Yet it is variation in scientific standards, and hence the validity of research findings, that fuels controversies in medical research. These often impinge on daily life, such that the public becomes confused about possible adverse health effects of numerous foods and drugs (Feinstein, 1988).

In general the emphasis is on results (which are presented as facts), with little or no regard to the manner in which they were obtained, which is probably why the subject of statistics is widely seen as relating solely to the analysis of data and the presentation of numerical results. While these are important parts of statistics, there is much else besides. In particular, how and why the data were collected are supremely important.

There is a wide perception of statistics (and perhaps statisticians too) as untrustworthy, as embodied in the idea that 'you can prove anything with statistics'. This saying, if it means anything, suggests that figures can be presented in a variety of ways, and that it is common for the most favourable view to be selected. While there is justification for this belief, it is not true that you can prove anything with statistics; the opposite is true, at least with regard to statistical methods used in research. Statistical analysis allows us to put limits on our uncertainty, but not to prove anything. Despite considerable mistrust of statistics, there is a tendency towards uncritical acceptance by the public of research findings, which may be attributed to the power of the printed word.


## 1.2 STATISTICS IN MEDICINE

Statistics are increasingly prevalent in medical practice. Nowadays much concern is devoted to hospital utility statistics, audit, resource allocation, vaccination uptake, numbers of new cases of AIDS, and so on. Journals and magazines for doctors are full of statistical material of this sort, as well as the findings of individual research studies. Statistical issues are implicit in all clinical practice when making diagnoses and choosing an appropriate treatment.

It is increasingly common to see statistical results from research papers quoted in promotional materials for drugs (especially) and other medical therapies. As an example, the following text is from an advertisement for a treatment for leukaemia appearing in a clinical oncology journal in 1989 (I have only changed the names of the drugs):


> **Significantly more first-course responders with NOVORAN**
>
> -  $63\%$  of all adults with ANLL treated with NOVORAN had a complete remission, compared with  $53\%$  of all patients treated with orsoran  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.15)$
>
> -  $56\%$  of patients had a complete remission after one induction course with NOVORAN, compared with  $36\%$  of patients treated with orsoran  $(\mathbf{P}< 0.01)$
>
> -  $89\%$  of complete responders to NOVORAN responded after a single induction course, compared with only  $68\%$  of complete responders to orsoran.
>
> - Single df $\chi^2$

To understand this passage it is necessary to know the meaning of expressions like  $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\bullet}\mathbf{P} = 0.15^{\circ}$  , and perhaps also the curious footnote. More importantly, however, we should wish to know how large the study was and what the design was. An appreciation of the methods by which these percentages were obtained and how to interpret them is thus at least useful and arguably essential for all those who treat patients. (We cannot obtain the information in this case as the results of this study were reported as being 'on file', i.e. unpublished.)

For those doing research statistical issues are fundamental, and so it is extremely important to understand basic statistical ideas relating to research design and data analysis, and to be familiar with the most common methods of statistical analysis.


## 1.3 STATISTICS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH

Colton (1974, p.1) observed that 'statistics pervades the medical literature'. Since then the huge influx of statistics into medical research has continued. The aim is to improve the reliability and credibility of the findings from medical research, but there is no guarantee that the statistical aspects have been handled well or even validly. As I shall show in the final chapter, there is considerable evidence that many published papers contain statistical errors.

There are many reasons why errors in statistics are a matter for concern. Put most simply, if there are statistical errors the conclusions of the study may be incorrect. Readers of the paper may not detect the error and may be misled either with respect to clinical practice or further research. While this argument may overestimate the influence of a single published paper, there is much evidence that readers of medical journals accept uncritically the printed word, as does the general public.

There is also a similar belief that statistics is about data analysis, perhaps because this is the most visible part of the statistical contribution. Data analysis is certainly an important part of statistics, but this narrow view

excludes in particular vital aspects relating to the design of research. Without the solid foundations of a good design the edifice of analysis is unsafe. Reliable results depend upon an appropriate research design: 'The justification for the analysis lies not in the data collected but in the manner in which the data were collected' (Schoolman et al., 1968). Many controversies in medicine are traceable to varying quality of the design of the research.


## 1.4 WHAT DOES STATISTICS COVER?

Figure 1.1 shows the general sequence of steps in a research project. Statistical thinking can contribute to every stage, although the major steps of design, analysis and interpretation will be the prime focus of this book.

The key difference between medical research and clinical practice is their scope. In each, data are collected from individual subjects, but in medical research the aim is to be able to make some general statements about a wider set of subjects, and we are not usually especially interested in the particular subjects that have been studied. We thus use information from a sample of individuals to make some inference about the wider population of like individuals. The three words in bold are formal statistical terms that will be explained fully in later chapters. The important point here is that the subjects who are studied act as a proxy for the total group of interest.

### 1.4.1 Research design

We can never study all diabetics, all pregnant women, or all people living in a geographical area. If we wish to investigate, for example, the relation between maternal weight gain in pregnancy and baby's birth weight we must study a sample of pregnant women. The aim of this research would be to extrapolate the findings from this sample to all pregnancies. For this inference to be reasonable, it is necessary for the sample of women to be representative of all pregnant women. In theory we can obtain a truly representative sample only by choosing women at random (a concept explained in Chapter 5) but even then the sample would be specific to a time period and geographical area. In practice, samples are nearly always chosen systematically and the subjects' characteristics are described so that their representativeness can be judged. The study just proposed would probably be carried out by taking all women registering at one or more specific hospitals in a set time period. In most studies it is necessary to exclude some people. Here women registering late in pregnancy would have to be excluded because they would not provide sufficient weight data. It is well known that this group is untypical in many respects. We might also wish to exclude premature births (<37 weeks) and there would probably be some other minor reasons for exclusion, such as diabetes and twins.

It is customary for the report of such a study to list the criteria for including or excluding subjects in the study, and to describe important characteristics of the sample at the start of the study; in this case these would include age, parity (number of previous children), height and weight. It is then a subjective matter to decide whether or not it is reasonable to take the findings from the study sample as being representative of all pregnant women.

A comparative study would involve the same considerations as the observational study just described. For example, we might wish to compare groups of women given different dietary advice. Here we have the additional issue of how to decide which women get which advice. We would like a method that would result in the women in the two groups being of similar age, parity and pre- pregnancy weight. Further, we want a method that excludes the possibility of subjective influence on who receives which advice.

All the issues just described come under the broad heading of design. and are thus part of the statistical contribution to research. Another aspect is determination of a suitable sample size for the study. I hope that this example has illustrated some of the reasons why a correct design is an essential part of good research, and thus the importance of good statistical input at this early stage. Different problems arise in each study, but there are many general principles for good design, which are discussed in

Chapter 5. Clinical trials are considered in detail in Chapter 15.

A consequence of the fundamental role of study design is that the most important part of a research paper is the Methods section. It is here that we learn what was done and if the results will be useful. A study of maternal weight gain carried out only on women of above average weight or restricted to pregnancies ending with low birth weight babies might be of no interest, regardless of the findings, and a study carried out in Britain may be of little relevance to the situation in Africa or Asia. Put more generally, we cannot make valid generalizations from unrepresentative or biased samples. The avoidance of bias is one of the main aims of sound research design.

The report of the aforementioned study of men at high risk of heart attacks was published in the British Medical Journal (Shaper et al., 1986). The 'Subjects and Methods' section of their paper (slightly shortened here) described exactly how the study was carried out:

The data used were derived from the British Regional Heart Study, which examined 7735 men aged 40- 59 randomly selected from the age- sex registers of representative group general practices in 24 towns in England, Wales and Scotland. The 24 towns were selected from those with populations of 50 000- 100 000; they represented the full range of cardiovascular disease mortality and included towns in all the major standard regions. The general practice selected in each town had a social class distribution representative of the town. The men were selected at random from age- sex registers; no attempt was made to exclude subjects with cardiovascular disease, and there was a  $78\%$  response rate.

Research nurses administered a questionnaire to and completed an examination of each man. In this study exposure to cigarette smoking was expressed as the number of years a man had smoked, irrespective of the quantity, as this was most strongly related to risk of ischaemic heart disease. Subjects were regarded as having angina if they indicated on the questionnaire that chest pain was present on exertion (walking uphill or hurrying). This included definite and possible angina. Results in this paper are confined to the 7506 men  $(97\%)$  with complete data on all the above risk factors.

Only when armed with this information and details of the methods of analysis, can we make a proper assessment of the appropriateness of the authors' conclusions to all men aged 40- 59. Extrapolation outside this age range is unwise.

If, however, important information is omitted from a paper, then we must reserve judgement on the findings. I consider this and other issues regarding reading medical papers in the final chapter.


### 1.4.2 Analysis and interpretation

Despite the preceding comments the analysis of data is the major part of learning about statistics. There are dozens of different methods of analysis, which makes difficult the choice of the correct method for a particular case. Before worrying about particular methods, however, it is necessary to consider the philosophy that underlies all methods of analysis. We will see that statistical methods of analysis are based on the same key idea that we use data from a sample to draw inferences about a wider population. Of course particular methods are important, but the general principles need to be absorbed first. The main general approaches to the statistical analysis of data are considered in Chapter 8, before particular methods are introduced.

The interpretation of results of statistical analysis is not always straightforward, but is simpler when the study has a clear aim and when there is an appreciation of the general principles that underlie the analysis. Indeed, if the study has been well designed and correctly analysed the interpretation of results can be fairly simple.


## 1.5 THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK

In this book I have tried to give prominence to the concepts and principles of statistical design and analysis before considering specific methods of analysing data. Thus it is not until Chapter 9 that I start to describe the more familiar methods of analysis. The earlier chapters cover basic material including, as well as the main ideas of design and analysis, consideration of different types of data that may be encountered and advice on how to use a computer for statistical analysis. Chapters 9 to 12 describe the main methods of statistical analysis, while Chapters 13 to 15 consider specific medical topics. In Chapter 16 I look at the way statistics is used in the medical literature, and give advice on reading and writing medical papers with respect to the statistical content.

Medical research falls into the broad areas of clinical research, laboratory research and epidemiology, which may be regarded as relating to people, samples from people or populations of people. In each case the individuals studied may be a mixture of healthy and ill people. I use the term 'clinical' to include research in surgery, dentistry, nursing, psychology and so on.

The statistical methods described in this book apply to all of these areas, although the specific problems may vary. Epidemiology, however, has many special features and statistical methods, which are covered comprehensively in specialized texts.

One problem when writing a statistics textbook is the likely variation among readers in their familiarity with mathematical methods. I have

adopted two devices to assist those who are less than comfortable with mathematics. Firstly, I have included an Appendix on mathematical notation (Appendix A), which includes brief explanations of all the terms used. Secondly, in most chapters I have put the mathematical formulae in self- contained sections, so that it is possible to read about a particular method without being confused or distracted by sometimes formidable looking equations. Although the formulae are not needed when using a computer, they do show the way in which the analysis works, and except in cases of extreme hypersensitivity I recommend that they should be examined. For the more advanced methods in later chapters I have not included the mathematical formulae as these are very complicated and the analyses are always done on a computer.

It is not necessary to be able to remember formulae - these can be looked up. What is important is to understand the general principles of the research process, from formulating an objective through all the steps shown in Figure 1.1, and to be aware of the limitations of what may or may not be deduced.

I do not pretend that statistics is easy to learn. On the contrary, I think it is rather difficult. Statistics is a curious amalgam of mathematics, logic and judgement. Although many are put off by the mathematics, it is often the logical processes that cause more difficulty - the principles of good design, and the concepts underlying data analysis and interpretation. If statistics were what many people expect, namely an extension of simple mathematics, it would be more straightforward. The mismatch between expectation and reality leads to many problems, a dislike of the subject, frustration and maybe even tears. In the past it has led to remarks such as the following: 'The truth of the matter is that most of us detest statistical analysis and welcome any excuse to dispense with it' (Seddon, 1937). Fortunately this is not an inevitable pathway. I hope that the approach that I have adopted in this book leads to a relatively painless acquisition of an understanding of statistics.
