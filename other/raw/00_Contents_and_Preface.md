# Preface

The difficulties many intelligent people have with 'sums' are infinite. Greenwood (1948)

This book on statistics is primarily aimed at medical researchers. Whether clinical or non- clinical, most will have received some statistics teaching as undergraduates, but it will have been fairly brief, a long time ago, and largely forgotten by the time it is needed. The book should also be useful to medical students, to clinicians who wish to understand the principles of the design and analysis of research, and to those attending postgraduate courses in medical statistics.

I have been motivated to write this book by the belief that most introductory texts do not explain adequately the concepts that underlie the whole subject of statistics, and in many cases they are divorced from the reality of carrying out and assessing medical research. This book should provide an understanding of the basic principles that underlie research design, data analysis and the interpretation of results, and enable the reader to carry out a wide range of statistical analyses. The emphasis is firmly on practical aspects of the design and analysis of medical research and I have paid special attention to the interpretation and presentation of results. By discussing both the use and misuse of statistics the book should also give the reader the material to be able to judge the appropriateness of the methods and interpretation in papers published in medical journals.

I have assumed that most researchers now have access to a computer so that the mathematical details are generally confined to self- contained sections that may be omitted. I have used real data throughout, mostly from published papers, and I have tried to find data that are interesting in their own right. In most cases all the raw data are given, so that the analyses can be reproduced either by computer or by hand calculation. This feature will assist in the evaluation of a statistical computer program.

Many data sets have been taken from published papers, not always used for the authors' original purpose. Some data sets have been reconstructed from graphs or summary statistics and others have come from my own collaborative studies. I thank everyone whose data I have used. I have tried to represent these studies fairly, and apologise if I have failed at all in this respect. I am grateful to the British Medical Journal and the British

Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for permission to reproduce figures and Ciba- Geigy Ltd, the Biometrika Trustees and Oliver and Boyd for permission to reproduce statistical tables. Almost all of the figures were produced using STATA and STAGE (Computing Resource Center, Los Angeles).

I wish to thank everyone who has helped me to write this book. The whole book was read in draft by Martin Bland, Caroline Dore, Sheila Gore and Richard Wootton to whom I am especially grateful, and I also thank Peter Clark, Bianca De Stavola, David Hill and Patrick Royston for reading certain chapters. Their comments and suggestions have been enormously valuable, but I must take the blame for any remaining infelicities or errors. I especially thank Judy MacDonald for typing the manuscript, and dealing with numerous revisions; thanks too to Olive Waldron and Clare Wood who typed early drafts. Lastly I thank Sue for her encouragement and support.
