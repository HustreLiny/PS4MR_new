standard deviations from the mean. From Table B1, the proportion of men taller than this would be 0.7422 (about  $74\%$ ). At the end of the 25 year period the minimum height was  $(172 - 179.1) / 5.84 = - 1.22$  standard deviations from the mean. From Table B1, the proportion of men above the minimum is now 0.8888, or about  $89\%$ . The proportion of ineligible men has more than halved.

4.7 If there is no change in the true blood pressure, each of a sequence of three measurements is equally likely to be in between the other two. The probability that the third measurement will not fall between the first two is thus two thirds (0.67), discounting the possibility of equal measurements. There is no reason to expect the third measurement to be between the first two and no reason to discard measurements as unreliable if they do not. If the intention is to use the average of the three readings in an analysis, the averages would be less well estimated for those with only two values.

4.8 (a) The probability of each child being unaffected is 0.75. The probability of two children being unaffected is  $0.75^{2} = 0.56$ , as these are independent events.

(b) The probability is 0.75. Each child has the same probability, regardless of the outcome for previous children.

(c) The probability of both parents being heterozygous for the abnormal gene is  $\frac{1}{22} \times \frac{1}{22} = 0.0021$ . The expected number of babies with cystic fibrosis per year is thus  $0.25 \times 3500 \times 0.0021$ , which is about 2.

## CHAPTER 5

5.1 (a) No, it is definitely wrong. If we want to see if a group of subjects has shifted its behaviour in some way we should re- examine the whole group. To study only a selected subset is to bias the sample being re- examined and thus to bias the results.

(b) The response rate in the second study was  $69\%$  which is rather poor. The non-responders, nearly a third of the sample, might well be atypical (this is what is usually found), and could well include heavier drinkers. For example, some may have been too ill to respond through a drink-related illness. Thus the high rate of non-response could have biased the results. The authors should have compared the characteristics of responders and non-responders with respect to their responses to the first survey. The paper does not give the response rate to the first study. If it was also around  $70\%$ , which is quite likely, then the final sample interviewed at the second survey would be even more highly selected.

(c) It is not a good idea, because drinking habits are not consistent throughout the year.

(d) No. First, we cannot necessarily interpret two simultaneous

changes over time as being causally related. Second, we would expect them to have found a reduction in the reported alcohol consumption, because the sample was biased to include only those drinking in the first study. If they had re- interviewed only those not drinking in the first study, we would expect them to have found an increase. This is one form of the phenomenon known as 'regression to the mean', and occurs when we remeasure a quantity on a sample selected by a restricted range of the same quantity on a previous occasion. Thus even when there has been no change over time, this study would be expected to have shown a decrease in alcohol consumption.

(e) No. For reasons given above, they are by no means representative. Further, they are a sample, not a population.

(f) The interpretation is not valid for the reasons noted above.

(g) No.

5.2 (a) It was a cross- sectional study.

(b) If the population of interest is taken as all menopausal British women, then the representativeness of this general practice is relevant. We have no information about this, although it does not seem unreasonable to carry out this type of study in a single practice. All 132 women born in 1930 were investigated, so there was no selection bias. However, we are assuming that the register of patients is accurate and complete, and the fact that 21/132 were not contactable casts some doubt on this. Of these 132 women, only 31 were actually studied, for the various reasons stated. Most of the exclusions are reasonable, although it is not clear why the unmarried women were excluded. The sample appears reasonably representative.

(c) The major problem with this study is that if the use of the pill delays the menopause then at the time of the study some women who will have had their menopause delayed will still have been premenopausal and so excluded from the study. The design does not allow the research objective to be investigated.

(d) This is a question that could be answered by a cohort study. If the researcher had taken, for example, all the women born in 1930 and waited until they had all reached the menopause, then he could make a valid comparison. However, it should be noted that it is not really good practice to lump together all pill users regardless of the length of pill use or the age at which it was taken. The cohort design would allow these factors to be investigated in relation to the age of menopause.

5.3 (a) Baseball players are clearly not truly representative of the population, but it is impossible to assess whether it matters in this particular case. However, it appears that there might have been a higher proportion of left- handers (14%) than we would expect in the population.

(b) If the prevalence of left-handedness had increased during the twentieth century, or if the prevalence within different social groups (with different mortality rates) had changed. Both of these are likely.

(c) The analysis would be biased towards including those born a long time ago as most recent players would still be alive. It is likely that left-handedness was less common earlier in the century than it is now. These two facts mean that the analysis would be biased towards earlier death among left-handers. Further, it is misleading to analyse mean age at death excluding those still alive. The correct analysis of survival data, which takes account of data for survivors too, is described in Chapter 13.

(d) It would be desirable to take a cohort of people born at about the same time, for example all those in the same year at school. In order to get a reasonable proportion of deaths, the survivors would need to be at least 70. It is most unlikely that such data are available and a prospective study would take a very long time! The baseball data would yield a more valid answer if analysed using an appropriate method, and if year of birth was considered in the analysis.

## CHAPTER 7

7.1 Figure A7.1 shows a scatter diagram of the data. The point that is most distant from the general trend is in the bottom left- hand corner, corresponding to patient 19. This patient's wedge pressure was actually  $28 \mathrm{mmHg}$ .

7.2 The following table shows the calculations:

<table><tr><td>T4</td><td>logcT4</td><td>P</td><td>Normal score</td></tr><tr><td>171</td><td>5.14</td><td>0.0309</td><td>-1.868</td></tr><tr><td>257</td><td>5.55</td><td>0.0802</td><td>-1.403</td></tr><tr><td>288</td><td>5.66</td><td>0.1296</td><td>-1.128</td></tr><tr><td>295</td><td>5.69</td><td>0.1790</td><td>-0.919</td></tr><tr><td>396</td><td>5.98</td><td>0.2284</td><td>-0.744</td></tr><tr><td>397</td><td>5.98</td><td>0.2778</td><td>-0.589</td></tr><tr><td>431</td><td>6.07</td><td>0.3272</td><td>-0.448</td></tr><tr><td>435</td><td>6.08</td><td>0.3765</td><td>-0.315</td></tr><tr><td>554</td><td>6.32</td><td>0.4259</td><td>-0.187</td></tr><tr><td>568</td><td>6.34</td><td>0.4753</td><td>-0.062</td></tr><tr><td>795</td><td>6.68</td><td>0.5247</td><td>0.062</td></tr><tr><td>902</td><td>6.80</td><td>0.5741</td><td>0.187</td></tr><tr><td>958</td><td>6.86</td><td>0.6235</td><td>0.315</td></tr><tr><td>1004</td><td>6.91</td><td>0.6728</td><td>0.448</td></tr><tr><td>1104</td><td>7.01</td><td>0.7222</td><td>0.589</td></tr><tr><td>1212</td><td>7.10</td><td>0.7716</td><td>0.744</td></tr><tr><td>1283</td><td>7.16</td><td>0.8210</td><td>0.919</td></tr><tr><td>1378</td><td>7.23</td><td>0.8704</td><td>1.128</td></tr><tr><td>1621</td><td>7.39</td><td>0.9198</td><td>1.403</td></tr><tr><td>2415</td><td>7.79</td><td>0.9691</td><td>1.868</td></tr></table>

The Normal scores can be obtained in many statistics packages. Otherwise they can be obtained by using Table B1 'in reverse'. The Normal plot of these data is very straight, as is shown in Figure A7.2.

![](../images/Anwers to exercises/img2.jpg)

7.3 The terminal digits (or penultimate digits in the case of dose of SA) are distributed as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>Digit 5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>14</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>SA</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>SI</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>48</td></tr></table>

Digit preference is a likely phenomenon for measurements, but would not be expected for information such as age. Nevertheless, the large number of ages ending in 9 is rather odd.

Both SA and SI show dramatic digit preference which is hard to explain. That for the total dose of SA is peculiar, especially as it represents the sum of doses given over at least six months. The SI is the ratio of two percentages, so the surfeit of zeros suggests imprecise recording.

7.4 Almost half (27/60) of the values end in zero. The other terminating digits are fairly evenly spread. This effect may be due to different observers reporting data to different precision.

## CHAPTER 8

8.1 (a) The larger hospital, simply because there are more births.

(b) The day to day variation in the proportion of boys will be greater in the smaller hospital, so it is more likely to have more than  $60\%$  of babies being boys on any day.

8.2 (a) The SE of the mean is  $\mathrm{SD} / \sqrt{n}$ , which is  $2.3629 / \sqrt{8} = 0.8354$

(b) The  $95\%$  CI for the mean is the range from mean  $-1.96$  SE to mean  $+1.96$  SE, so the width of the CI is  $2 \times 1.96 \times \mathrm{SE}$ . For this to be equal to  $0.5 \mathrm{mmol / l}$  we need  $\mathrm{SE} = \frac{0.5}{2 \times 1.96} = 0.1276$ . Assuming that we still have  $\mathrm{SD} = 2.3629$ , then we would have  $2.3629 / \sqrt{N} = 0.1276$  which gives  $N = (2.3629 / 0.1276)^2 = 343$

8.3 Another way of phrasing the question is, 'What is the probability of the number in one group being less than 40 or more than 60?'. The sampling distribution for the proportion of patients allocated a particular treatment is the Binomial distribution. The SD of the distribution is  $\sqrt{np(1 - p)}$ . Here  $p = 0.5$ , so the SD is  $\sqrt{100 \times 0.5 \times 0.5} = 5$ . Using the Normal approximation, which is excellent for  $p = 0.5$ , the required probability is the two- tailed area corresponding to  $z = (60 - 50) / 5 = 2.0$ , which from Table B2 is 0.0455, or about  $5\%$ .

8.4 The use of a one- tailed test should always be specified and justified.

The justification, which I believe is rarely appropriate, is that the experimenters are only interested in a difference in a particular direction. Results of previous analyses are not an adequate justification for performing a one- tailed test.

## CHAPTER 9

9.1 (a) If the changes have a reasonably Normal distribution, then a CI could be obtained using the  $t$  distribution as described in sections 9.4.1 and 9.5.1, and a paired  $t$  test could be used (or, equivalently, a one sample  $t$  test of the differences). A Wilcoxon test for matched data could be used if the differences had a reasonably symmetric but non- Normal distribution.

A Normal plot of the changes is quite straight, and the  $W'$  test gives  $W' = 0.98$ ,  $P = 0.96$ , so either of the above methods is appropriate. Because the changes have a nearly Normal distribution they will give very similar results. Using the parametric approach, the  $95\%$  confidence interval for the mean change in supine heart rate in the countermeasure group is 1.38 to 12.38 beats/min. The paired  $t$  test gives  $t = 2.65$  ( $P = 0.017$ ). The data thus appear to show that the countermeasure has reduced heart rate, but the correct approach is to compare this group with a group who did not adopt the countermeasure, as discussed below.

(b) The changes in heart rate in the group not adopting the countermeasure were not significantly non-Normal ( $W' = 0.865$ ,  $P = 0.10$ ), and the SDs in the two groups were very similar, so we can use a two sample  $t$  test to compare the changes in heart rate in the two groups. The difference between the mean changes is 10.56 and the  $95\%$  CI is 1.62 to 19.50, giving some evidence in support of the effectiveness of the countermeasure. The two sample  $t$  test gives  $t = 2.44$  ( $P = 0.023$ ).

(c) It is incorrect to analyse multiple observations on the same individuals as if they were from different people. Here the effect is likely to be minimal as only two astronauts were included twice. The duplicate data were not identified in the paper.

(d) In clinical research it is highly undesirable to let subjects choose their own treatments. No clinical trial conducted in this way would have credibility. Ideally (from the research point of view) the astronauts should have been randomized to receive the dietary countermeasure, but this was not set up as a prospective study. The likely homogeneity of the astronauts, for example with respect to fitness, would probably lessen the volunteer effect. Clearly the pre-flight heart rates in the two groups were very similar, which strengthens the findings. In the end the validity of the results is a matter of judgement.

9.2 (a) The paired  $t$  test gives  $t = 1.85$ ,  $P = 0.08$ . However, the test

assumes that the differences have a reasonably Normal distribution, which is clearly not the case here.

(b) Even after log transformation of the original data the differences between the log values have a skewed distribution. Although the paired  $t$  test gives  $t = 2.77$ ,  $\mathbf{P} = 0.01$ , it is better to use the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test, which gives  $z = 2.91$ ,  $\mathbf{P} = 0.004$ .

9.3 As was shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.3, log transformation makes these data much nearer to Normal. The mean  $\log_{e} \mathbf{T}_{4}$  counts for the Hodgkin's and non- Hodgkin's disease patients were 6.487 and 6.089 respectively, giving a difference of 0.398 (SE = 0.212). The 90% CI is 0.041 to 0.756. The antilogs of these values are 1.04 and 2.13, which give a 90% CI for the ratio of the  $\mathbf{T}_{4}$  counts in the two groups. The best estimate of the ratio is  $\exp (0.398) = 1.49$ .

9.4 The linear analogue scale data do not meet the distributional assumptions for parametric methods based on the  $t$  distribution. The groups can be compared using the non- parametric Mann- Whitney test, which gives  $z = 3.29$ ,  $\mathbf{P} = 0.001$ . There is thus strong evidence that nausea was less severe in patients receiving the active treatment.

A 95% confidence interval for the difference in median scores can be obtained using the method described by Campbell and Gardner (1989), and is 15 to 49 mm. In general estimates and confidence intervals are of limited value for data like these as the measurements have no straightforward interpretation.

9.5 (a) The SDs can be calculated by multiplying the SEs by  $\sqrt{n}$  to give

<table><tr><td>Cigarettes</td><td>n</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>1-9</td><td>25</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.40</td></tr><tr><td>10-19</td><td>57</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>20-29</td><td>99</td><td>0.87</td><td>1.89</td></tr><tr><td>30-39</td><td>38</td><td>1.03</td><td>1.54</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 40</td><td>28</td><td>1.56</td><td>3.02</td></tr><tr><td>Unspecified</td><td>25</td><td>0.56</td><td>0.80</td></tr></table>

As in all cases the SD is greater than the mean (and negative values are impossible), the urinary cotinine excretion values are highly skewed to the right.

(b) Some form of analysis of trend, such as within a one way analysis of variance.

(c) If the data are to be analysed by analysis of variance then we require standard deviations to be similar (in theory the groups are samples from populations with the same standard deviation). There is no such requirement for standard errors, which are partly dependent

on sample size. As shown above, the data do not meet this requirement. If log transformation would yield similar SDs and reasonably Normal distributions, then a linear trend could be applied in a one way analysis of variance. The 'unspecified' group would have to be excluded. The simplest approach would be to calculate the rank correlation between number of cigarettes smoked and urinary cotinine level.

(d) There are three reasons why this analysis is not valid:

(i) the data are highly skewed within each group;

(ii) the SDs vary enormously;

(iii) the use of multiple comparisons of pairs of groups is an inferior method of assessing whether there is a relation between smoking and urinary cotinine levels as it takes no account of the ordering of the groups.

9.6 The P values associated with paired Wilcoxon tests of the data for Groups 1 and 2 are 0.01 and 0.09, which are not so far apart. More revealing are the means and standard deviations of the changes:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Group 1</td><td>-0.078</td><td>0.073</td></tr><tr><td>Group 2</td><td>-0.071</td><td>0.129</td></tr></table>

The mean changes in the two groups are almost the same.

The correct way to compare the groups is by testing directly the difference between the changes in the two groups. A two sample  $t$  test gives  $t = 0.16$  on 22 degrees of freedom  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.88)$ . The SDs are rather different, so that the assumptions of the  $t$  test may not be considered reasonable. A similar result is, however, obtained from a Mann- Whitney test  $(z = 0.89, \mathbf{P} = 0.37)$ . There is thus no evidence to support the idea that the groups differ.

9.7 (a) The post- treatment scores should be compared by the Mann- Whitney test because the data are not suitable for the  $t$  test. This analysis gives  $z = 3.22$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.001)$ , strong evidence that gestrinone is more effective than placebo in improving the scores of these patients.

(b) The same method can be applied to the changes in scores. This analysis gives  $z = 2.71$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.007)$ , a result which is only slightly weaker. Alternatively the sign test could be used to compare the groups with respect to positive or negative changes.

9.8 The Mann- Whitney test could be used. As it is a test based on ranks, the censored values recorded as  $>80.0$  would all have the same rank. As there are so many ties at this value the adjustment for ties would be desirable. Also, the SI values clearly have a skewed distribution,

indicating that a non- parametric method would be suitable. An alternative, but less satisfactory, approach would be to compare the proportions above a given cut- off using methods described in the next chapter.

## CHAPTER 10

10.1 (a) It is essential to use an analysis appropriate for paired data. The proportions negative to croton oil and DNCB were  $44 / 173 = 25.4\%$  and  $69 / 173 = 39.9\%$  respectively. A  $95\%$  CI for the difference between these proportions, using the method given in section 10.4, is from  $5\%$  to  $24\%$ . The hypothesis test that the proportions of patients negative to the two skin tests are the same is evaluated by calculating

$$
z = \frac{48 - 23}{\sqrt{48 + 23}} = 2.97
$$

which, from Table B2, corresponds to  $\mathbf{P} = 0.003$ . There is thus strong evidence that fewer of these patients show negative reactions to croton oil than DNCB.

(b) The proportions of patients with a positive reaction to DNCB are  $75\%$ ,  $67\%$  and  $41\%$  for stages I, II and III respectively. The Chi squared test for trend gives  $X_{\text{trend}}^{2} = 14.04$  on 1 degree of freedom  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.0002)$ . There is strong evidence therefore that DNCB reactivity is related to stage of cancer.

10.2 (a) The author seems to have concluded that  $\mathbf{P} > 0.05$  means that there is no effect present. However, the  $\mathbf{P}$  value is 0.08 and so only slightly greater than 0.05.

(b) The test considered in 
(a) is not appropriate because it ignored the fact that the groups were ordered. The aim of the study was explicitly to study the relation between testosterone level (examined by the proxy measure of the sex ratio of siblings) and level of singing voice, so the Chi squared test for trend should be used. The test gives  $X^{2} = 8.92$  on 1 degree of freedom, which is highly significant  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.003)$ . We can therefore infer that there is a relation between level of singing voice and sex ratio of siblings, assuming that the test is a valid one (but see below). This does not, of course, directly answer the question about testosterone levels as they were not measured on this sample.

(c) It was chosen after inspecting the data, so the  $\mathbf{P}$  value is not valid. In any case, it is not sensible to ignore the ordering - the trend test is far preferable.

(d) The value of  $X^{2}$  for part of the table cannot exceed the value for the whole table. The correct value for this comparison is  $X^{2} = 9.44$  on 2 degrees of freedom.

(e) The observations are not independent, as the 422 siblings related to only 195 singers. Large families will carry more influence than small ones.

(f) It is not easy to say how important the non-independence is. If this is considered to be a preliminary study, leading to a study with direct analysis of testosterone levels if the results look suggestive (as they do), then it is probably not too important. In any case, there is no simple statistical way round the problem. We could study only singers with one sibling; choose one sibling at random for each singer; take each singer's oldest sibling, none of which would be very satisfactory. A completely valid statistical analysis would be highly complex.

10.3 (a) Yes, but it was not necessary. The observed frequencies were 2 and 20, but the expected frequencies (under the null hypothesis) were about 10 so the Chi squared test could have been used.

(b) The confidence intervals are based on the Normal approximation. This is not valid for the very small proportion in the placebo group, and has led to an impossible negative lower limit. More fundamentally, it is not helpful to give confidence intervals for each group separately. The  $95\%$  confidence interval for the difference in proportions is much more useful; it is  $16\%$  to  $39\%$ .

10.4 (a) The Mann- Whitney test or the Chi squared test for trend could be used. Each would require scores to be given to each column. These could reasonably be equally spaced; most obviously the values 1 to 8 could be used.

(b) The Mann-Whitney test is hard to apply when the samples are so large (most computer programs cannot perform the test on a table, but would require data for the 3469 children). The Chi squared test can be applied equally easily regardless of sample size. The overall comparison of the eight groups gives  $X^{2} = 7.83$  on 7 degrees of freedom  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.35)$ , and the trend test gives  $X_{\text{trend}}^{2} = 0.04$  on 1 degree of freedom  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.84)$ . These figures indicate that the variation seen is likely to be due to chance and not to a tendency for boys to sleep longer than girls or vice versa.

10.5 (a) There is only one Chi squared test for a  $2 \times 2$  table, which can be interpreted as either a comparison of the proportions in each row or in each column. The two tests described should have given the same answer.

(b) The correct test statistic is either  $X^{2} = 15.90$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.0001)$  or  $X_{c}^{2} = 13.93$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.0002)$  depending on whether Yates' correction is used. Thus both of the quoted results were incorrect.

10.6 It is clear from the table that some patients had more than one of the three habits, as would be expected. It is incorrect, therefore, to calculate  $X^{2}$  for the full  $4 \times 3$  table. If we knew each patient's habits,

then a complex regression analysis could be performed, using methods described in Chapter 12. From the available data we could construct  $3 \times 2$  tables for each habit and calculate the test statistic  $X^{2}$  on 2 degrees of freedom.

10.7 The proportions of women developing hypertension were 0.1176 (4/34) in the aspirin group and 0.3548 (11/31) in the placebo group. The difference is 0.24 with a wide  $95\%$  CI from 0.04 to 0.44. The Chi squared test with Yates' correction gives  $X^{2} = 3.89$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.049)$ . There is thus a suggestion that aspirin may reduce the risk of hypertension among pregnant women, but the wide CI points to considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect.

10.8 From the information given a  $2 \times 2$  table can be constructed as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="4">Cases</td></tr><tr><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>Total</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Controls</td><td>+</td><td>38</td><td>8</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>58</td><td>28</td><td>86</td></tr></table>

where  $+$  and  $-$  refer to presence or absence of exposure to loud noise at work.

(a) The proportions of cases and controls reporting exposure to loud noise were 0.674 (58/86) and 0.535 (46/86). The difference in proportions is 0.14, with the  $95\%$  CI of 0.02 to 0.26. The proportions can be compared using McNemar's test, which gives

$$
z_{c} = 11 / \sqrt{28} = 2.08 (\mathrm{P} = 0.04).
$$

(b) The odds ratio is estimated as  $20 / 8 = 2.5$ . The  $95\%$  CI (method not given in Chapter 10) is 1.05 to 6.56.

## CHAPTER 11

11.1 (a) Yes. The censored survival time was also the longest and thus gets the highest rank. The method cannot generally be used for survival data because the censored data mean that the order of survival times cannot be determined.

(b) The Pearson correlation coefficient could be calculated but it would be severely inflated by the very long survival time (even ignoring the censoring). The distribution of survival times is highly skewed, so rank correlation is far preferable here.

(c) The changes in lactate, bicarbonate and pH have Spearman rank

correlation coefficients with survival time of 0.63,  $- 0.67$  and  $- 0.42$  respectively, so the strongest relation is with changes in bicarbonate. Note that bicarbonate and  $\mathbf{pH}$  have negative associations with survival while for lactate the correlation is positive.

11.2 (a) The linear regression equation is

$$
\mathbf{RMR} = 811.23 + 7.0595\times \mathrm{weight}
$$

and the residual SD is 157.91 kcal/24hr.

(b) A scatter diagram shows no obvious relation between the residuals and weight. The test of Normality of the residuals gives  $W' = 0.955$ ,  $P > 0.05$ . The distribution is reasonably Normal - the largest residual relates to the woman with the highest RMR. Overall, there is no reason to reject the validity of the analysis.

(c) The SE of the slope of the regression line is 0.9776 kcal/24 hr, so the 95% CI is

$$
7.0595 - 2.018\times 0.9776\mathrm{to}7.0595 + 2.018\times 0.9776
$$

or 5.09 to 9.03 kcal/24 hr.

(d) The SD of the residuals is 157.91 kcal/24 hr, so the narrowest prediction interval (at the mean value of body weight) is about twice this amount either side of the predicted value. Thus it is not possible to predict RMR from body weight to within 250 kcal/24 hr.

11.3 (a) The regression of  $\log_{e}Vcf$  on blood glucose gives the equation

$$
\log_{e}Vcf = 0.115 + 0.0148\times \mathrm{blood~glucose}.
$$

The residual SD is 0.2167.

(b) The test of Normality of the residuals from this regression line gives  $W' = 0.936$ ,  $P > 0.1$ . The residuals after log transformation are thus more nearly Normal than those from the analysis of the raw data.

(c) From the regression equation using the raw values of Vcf (Table 11.6) the predicted Vcf is  $1.10 + 0.0220\times 16 = 1.45\% /\mathrm{sec}$ . The 95% prediction interval is  $1.45\pm 2.080\times 0.229$  or 0.97 to  $1.93\% /\mathrm{sec}$ . From the above regression equation using log transformed Vcf, the predicted Vcf is  $\exp (0.115 + 0.0148\times 16) = e^{0.352} = 1.42\% /\mathrm{sec}$ . The 95% prediction interval is  $\exp (0.352\pm 2.080\times 0.164)$  or 1.01 to  $2.00\% /\mathrm{sec}$ . The two equations thus give similar answers for someone with a blood glucose of 16 mmol/l.

11.4 The values for the last two subjects are identical, suggesting a transcription error or the inadvertent inclusion of the same patient twice.

11.5 The correlations between log creatinine clearance (CC), log digoxin clearance (DC) and urine flow are:

<table><tr><td></td><td>r</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>DC CC</td><td>0.838</td><td>&amp;lt; 0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>DC flow</td><td>0.515</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>CC flow</td><td>0.322</td><td>0.06</td></tr></table>

These figures support the first statement but do not appear to support the second. A better answer is obtained by considering all three variables at once, by calculating the partial correlation coefficients. The partial correlation coefficient between DC and CC adjusting for urine flow is 0.83  $(\mathbf{P}< 0.0001)$  , and that between DC and flow adjusting for CC is 0.47 (0.005), hardly different from the simple correlation coefficients. The data thus support the first but not the second of the statements about digoxin clearance.

## CHAPTER 12

12.1 (a) (i) A paired t test or, equivalently, a two way analysis of variance.

(ii) Same as (i).

(b) The data of interest can be rewritten as

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Subject</td><td colspan="2">Diet</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>O</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.77</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.39</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0.18</td><td>0.25</td></tr></table>

The mean and SD of the differences between the diets (O- N) are 0.182 and 0.160, so the paired t test gives  $t = 2.545$  . The appropriate value of the t distribution  $(t_{0,07})$  on 4 degrees of freedom is 2.776. to the difference is not quite statistically significant at the  $5\%$  level  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.06)$  . The  $95\%$  CI for the mean difference is 0.1222.776 x 0.160/ V5 or - 0.02 to 0.38. The two way analysis of variance, with factors diet and subject, gives  $F = 6.48$  for the comparison between the diets - this is the square of the t value expected.

12.2 Backwards stepwise multiple regression yields the following model

$$
FRC = 286.94 - 4.1965 x age - 2.0386 x FEV1
$$

The residual SD is 26.7, compared with the SD of the raw FRC

values which was 43.7, indicating that the model explains a good proportion of the variability in FRC. The value of  $R^{2}$  is  $66\%$ .

A test of Normality of the residuals gives  $W' = 0.966$ ,  $P > 0.2$ , indicating that the residuals have a closely Normal distribution.

12.3 (a) Recipient and donor ages can be compared by two sample  $t$  tests, as can the log index values (the raw index values are skewed). The results of these are

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">No GvHD</td><td colspan="2">GvHD</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>t</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Recip age</td><td>22.4</td><td>5.18</td><td>28.4</td><td>8.10</td><td>2.73</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Donor age</td><td>23.1</td><td>6.69</td><td>29.0</td><td>8.07</td><td>2.43</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>Log index</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.860</td><td>1.115</td><td>0.662</td><td>3.92</td><td>0.0006</td></tr></table>

The type of leukaemia and whether the donor had been pregnant can be related to GvHD by Chi squared tests:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Type of leukaemia</td><td colspan="2">Donor pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AML</td><td>ALL</td><td>CML</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>No GvHD</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>18</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>GvHD</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr></table>

$X^{2} = 7.497$  on 2 df  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.02)$ $X^{2} = 4.66$  on 1 df  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.03)$

Thus all five variables are significantly different between the groups of patients who did and did not develop GvHD. This suggests that it might be possible to find a logistic regression model that discriminates usefully between the groups.

(b) The results given here relate to backward stepwise multiple logistic regression with the following potential explanatory variables: recipient's age, donor's age, donor pregnancy, log index, and two dummy variables indicating whether the patient did 
(1) or did not 
(0) have ALL and CML. Using the  $5\%$  level of statistical significance to decide whether to retain a variable in the analysis, the following model is obtained:

<table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>SE</td><td>z</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-2.546</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CML</td><td>2.251</td><td>1.106</td><td>2.035</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>Pregnancy</td><td>2.496</td><td>1.101</td><td>2.266</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>Log index</td><td>1.488</td><td>0.720</td><td>2.067</td><td>0.04</td></tr></table>

All three variables in this model are only moderately significant.

For each patient we can calculate the probability of GvHD on the basis of this model, and relate these to what actually happened. The probability  $p$  is obtained from the logistic regression model:

$l = \mathrm{logit}(p)$ $= - 2.546 + 2.251\times \mathrm{CML} + 2.496\times \mathrm{pregnancy} + 1.488\times \mathrm{log}$  index

or

$$
p = \exp {(l)} / [1 + \exp {(l)}].
$$

It should be remembered that the assessment of a model using the same data that were used to derive the model will give a slightly optimistic picture. It is best to use new data to test a model.

(c) For a binary variable in a logistic regression model, the odds ratio is given by  $\mathbf{e}^{b}$  where  $b$  is the estimated regression coefficient. This corresponds to the increased odds associated with being in the group coded 1 compared to the group coded 0.

For CML we have  $\mathbf{OR} = \mathbf{e}^{2.251} = 9.5$  and for pregnancy we have  $\mathbf{OR} = \mathbf{e}^{2.496} = 12.1$  .  $90\%$  CIs are obtained as  $\mathbf{e}^{b\pm 1.645\mathrm{SE}(b)}$  . For CML these values are 1.54 and 58.6; for pregnancy they are 1.98 and 74.2. Both CIs are extremely wide, showing that precise estimates cannot be obtained from a sample this small.

12.4 (a)  $\mathbf{e}^{1.167} = 3.21$

(b)  $1000\times 1.167 / 0.0106 = 110094$  . Smoking 20 cigarettes per day is equal to  $20\times 365 = 7300$  per year, so a total of about 110000 cigarettes is equivalent to smoking 20 per day for about 15 years.

(c) The total number of cigarettes smoked is  $20\times 365\times 30 =$  219000, so the odds ratio is exp  $(1.167 + 219\times 0.0106) = 32.7$  . This is ten times the odds ratio for family history in a non-smoker.

12.5 (a) The multiple regression model is

<table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>SE</td><td>t</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-6.7459</td><td>4.3923</td><td>-1.536</td><td>0.14</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>-0.0260</td><td>0.0241</td><td>-1.080</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>Sex</td><td>-0.8029</td><td>0.5120</td><td>-1.568</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>0.0880</td><td>0.0252</td><td>3.497</td><td>0.002</td></tr></table>

Only height is statistically significant in this model. The residual SD is 1.185 and  $R^{2} = 0.54$  . The residual SD is the SD of the differences between the observed values and those predicted by the regression model. This represents a considerable reduction in comparison with the SD of 1.657 for the raw lung capacity values, but still indicates a large prediction error in some cases. For  $5\%$  of cases we would

expect the model to err by more than about 2.37 l (twice the residual SD), which is more than a third of the mean lung volume (which is 6.05 l).

(b) The linear regression equation of lung volume on height is

$$
\mathrm{lung~volume} = -9.869 + 0.0951\times \mathrm{height}.
$$

The SE of the slope is 0.0184 and the residual SD is 1.227, and  $R^{2} = 0.47$ . These values suggest that the multiple regression model fits the data only marginally better than the linear regression on height, as was indicated by the non- significant coefficients for age and sex in the first model.

(c) Using the above results of linear regression of lung volume on height, the  $95\%$  prediction interval for someone with average lung capacity is

$$
6.047 \pm 2.042 \times 1.227 \sqrt{1 + 1 / 32}
$$

or 3.50 to 8.59 l.

(d) The simple way is to carry out separate regressions for males and females, which give slopes of 0.0736 and 0.0745.

However, the correct way to test the hypothesis that the slopes are the same is by fitting a multiple regression model including an interaction term. As we would expect from the similar slopes just given, the interaction is nowhere near to being statistically significant. As we have also seen that there was no significant effect of sex in the multiple regression model, we can reasonably conclude that the relation between lung volume and height is the same for males and females.

##CHAPTER 13

13.1 If we take the three values censored before the end of the experiment as events, we get

$$
O_{1} = 7; \quad E_{1} = 10.2339; \quad O_{2} = 15; \quad E_{2} = 11.7661
$$

giving  $X^{2} = 1.91$ ,  $P = 0.17$ . The evidence for a difference is now much weaker.

13.2 (a) Because the longest survival time is so much greater than the next longest, the meaningful early part of the curve will be severely compressed at the left hand side. The graph is much more useful if this patient is excluded. As noted in section 13.8.2, stopping the curve when there are only five patients still alive will usually give a more reliable visual impression.

(b) The logrank test is used to compare survival in different groups of patients. Where the variable of interest is continuous, as here, we can

create groups of patients corresponding to broad ranges of values and perform the logrank test for trend.

A common approach is to divide the patients into three equal sized groups. Groups of size 10, 10 and 9 give the following results:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Variable</td><td colspan="3">Logrank X²</td></tr><tr><td>Overall (2 df)</td><td>Trend (1 df)</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Lactate</td><td>10.19</td><td>9.47</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>Bicarbonate</td><td>17.26</td><td>15.01</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>pH</td><td>6.10</td><td>4.62</td><td>0.03</td></tr></table>

For each variable the trend is statistically significant, and most of the variation between groups is due to the trend. Thus the changes in all of the three variables are related to survival time.

(c) Cox regression models of each of the three variables treated either as continuous or split into three groups as in the previous analysis are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">b</td><td colspan="2">Continuous</td><td rowspan="2">P</td><td rowspan="2">b</td><td colspan="2">Grouped</td><td rowspan="2">P</td></tr><tr><td>SE(b)</td><td></td><td>SE(b)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lactate</td><td>-0.071</td><td>0.019</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.061</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.01</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bicarbonate</td><td>0.186</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.087</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.0001</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>pH</td><td>3.921</td><td>1.704</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.965</td><td>0.395</td><td>0.02</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The regression coefficients,  $b$ , should not be directly compared for the two types of analysis. All three variables are significantly associated with survival by either method, but the level of significance differs. In general, the grouped analysis will give a very similar answer to the logrank test for trend.

If the three variables are all entered into a Cox model together only bicarbonate is statistically significant.

13.3 (a) The opposite signs mean that high values of one variable and low values of the other variable are associated with an increased risk of dying. A positive regression coefficient means that high values of that variable are associated with worse survival, and conversely for a negative coefficient. Thus the model predicts that survival is worse for non- CML patients and those with GvHD.

(b) We need to calculate the prognostic index for each group of patients. These are as follows:

PI non- GvHD non- CML 0.000 non- GvHD CML - 2.508 GvHD non- CML 2.306 GvHD CML - 0.202 (= - 2.508 + 2.306)

The relative risk of dying relative to the non- GvHD non- CML group is simply  $\mathbf{e}^{\mathbf{PI}}$  as the PI for that group is zero. Thus the risks of dying in the other groups relative to non- GvHD non- CML patients are

non- GvHD CML 0.08 GvHD non- CML 10.03 GvHD CML 0.82

(c) The  $95\%$  CI is given by the range  $e^{2.306 - 1.96 \times 0.5898}$  to  $e^{2.306 + 1.96 \times 0.5898}$ , or 3.16 to 31.9.

(d) A Cox model based on such a small sample would be extremely unreliable, as is indicated by the wide CI given above. It is the number of 'events', here deaths, that determines the power of a Cox analysis, not the number of subjects.

## CHAPTER 14

14.1 (a) The Wilcoxon test (or the  $t$  test) assesses whether the values obtained by the two methods differ on average. It is essential also to consider how well they agree for individual patients, which cannot be done by a hypothesis test.

(b) A simple analysis is based on calculating the  $95\%$  limits of agreement from the mean and SD of the differences between the two methods, and by plotting the differences against the average of the two values.

The mean and SD of the differences ( $^{51}\mathrm{Cr}$ - biotin) are  $- 85.0$  and  $221.9 \mathrm{ml}$  respectively, so the  $95\%$  limits of agreement are  $- 529$  to  $+359 \mathrm{ml}$ . This very wide range is completely disguised by the non- significant Wilcoxon test. Figure A14.1 shows the differences plotted against the average of the two values. There is no evidence that the magnitude of the differences varies with red cell volume. The  $95\%$  limits of agreement are shown as solid lines.

(c) The red cell volumes of these patients may be systematically different from those in the healthy population. It does not necessarily follow that the methods would agree equally badly (or equally well) in a different population with a different range of red cell volumes.

(d) If one method is affected by consumption of eggs then it would be advisable to exclude patients who had eaten eggs. In contrast, it would be completely invalid to omit some patients simply because

![](../images/Anwers to exercises/img3.jpg)

their data were discrepant. The authors' comment is curious, as they do not say which of the patients had eaten an egg. If the two patients with suspect values are excluded, the mean and SD of the between method differences become  $- 20.2$  and  $112.2 \mathrm{ml}$  , a considerable improvement. The revised limits of agreement are shown in Figure A14.1 as dashed lines.

14.2 (a) The means are plotted in Figure A14.2. The means for the two groups show a very similar pattern.

![](../images/Anwers to exercises/img4.jpg)

(b) The mean and SD of the peak values and areas under the curves for the two groups are

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Rheumatoid arthritis</td><td colspan="2">Controls</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">patients</td><td rowspan="2">SD</td><td rowspan="2">SD</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Peak</td><td>39.96</td><td>9.13</td><td>46.12</td><td>10.58</td></tr><tr><td>AUC</td><td>120.05</td><td>33.61</td><td>154.93</td><td>48.23</td></tr></table>

The two groups can be compared by two sample  $t$  tests, which give  $t = 1.53$  ( $\mathbf{P} = 0.14$ ) and  $t = 2.06$  ( $\mathbf{P} = 0.052$ ) respectively. (Mann- Whitney tests give very similar results.) There is thus some evidence that the area under the curve is lower among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

(c) The individual curves shown in Figure A14.3 show considerable variation - many look very different from the mean curves. It is a matter of judgement whether the means are a good representation of the overall pattern.

![](../images/Anwers to exercises/img5.jpg)  
Figure A14.3 Time (hours)

14.3 (a) The two thirds of drug users who admitted the fact would not be allowed to give blood. Among the other third we would expect 0.24 (24%) to pass the test, and thus give blood. Among the non- drug users we would expect 0.63 (63%) to pass the test and give blood.

Thus the proportion of blood donors who would be drug users is

$$
\frac{0.24 \times 0.33 \times 0.05}{0.24 \times 0.33 \times 0.05 + 0.63 \times 0.95} = 0.007.
$$

(b) Among the two thirds of drug users who lied, we would expect 0.76 (76%) to fail the polygraph test. Among non-drug users we would expect 0.37 (37%) to fail the test too. Thus the expected proportion of drug users among those failing the test is

$$
\frac{0.76 \times 0.33 \times 0.05}{0.76 \times 0.33 \times 0.05 + 0.37 \times 0.95} = 0.035.
$$

In other words, almost all of those rejected by the test (about 96%) would be non- drug users. To pick up one drug user it would be necessary to reject falsely about 27 genuine donors.

14.4 (a) Taking the cut- off as respiratory rates less than or equal to 30, 40, 50 or 60 breaths/min gives

<table><tr><td>Cut-off</td><td>Sensitivity</td><td>Specificity</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>141/142 = 99%</td><td>16/151 = 11%</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>137/142 = 96%</td><td>93/151 = 62%</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>127/142 = 89%</td><td>139/151 = 92%</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>86/142 = 61%</td><td>148/151 = 98%</td></tr></table>

The best cut- off is 50 breaths/min, with an overall correct assessment for  $266 / 293 = 91\%$  of infants.

(b) Using the formulae for the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) given in section 14.4.5, the required values are

<table><tr><td>Cut-off</td><td>PPV</td><td>NPV</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>3.3%</td><td>99.8%</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>7%</td><td>99.8%</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>26%</td><td>99.6%</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>49%</td><td>98.8%</td></tr></table>

With low prevalence, as here, the NPV is usually not helpful. The PPV increases as the cut off level rises, so the 'best' choice to maximize correct predictions is a cut- off of 60 breaths/min. However, as we have seen, with this cut- off nearly half of the infants with LRI would be missed. A cut- off of 50 breaths/min would mean that nearly all infants with LRI would be identified, but that more of the infants identified by the test would not have LRI (false positives) compared with a cut- off of 60 breaths/min. Note that about half of the study

sample had LRI - they were inpatients and thus unrepresentative of the general population of infants with acute respiratory infection where the prevalence of LRI is much lower.

(c) The PPV is the proportion of those infants with respiratory rate  $>50$  who have LRI, which is  $26\%$ . Thus if all infants with a respiratory rate above the cut-off are treated with antibiotics,  $74\%$  of them will have been treated 'unnecessarily'. The sensitivity is  $89\%$  at this cut-off, which means that  $89\%$  of LRI infants would receive antibiotics. Thus  $11\%$  would not get antibiotics. At the lower cut-off of 40 breaths/min the proportion with LRI treated with antibiotics would be rather higher  $(96\%)$  but only  $7\%$  of those treated would have LRI. It should be clear that the choice of cut-off must be made on non-statistical considerations.

(d) If all infants above the cut-off are treated then  $89\%$  of LRI infants and  $8\%$  of URI infants would be treated. Taking the proportion with LRI as  $3\%$ , the proportion treated would be  $0.89 \times 0.03 + 0.08 \times 0.97 = 0.10$ . Thus only  $10\%$  of infants would be treated with antibiotics, representing an enormous saving in cost. Even using a cutoff of 40 breaths/min the proportion treated would be  $0.96 \times 0.03 + 0.38 \times 0.97 = 0.40$ , which would cost half as much as the existing policy.

14.5 (a) For each pair of dentists each tooth can be categorized SS, SC, CS or CC by aggregating the relevant rows of the table. The resulting  $2 \times 2$  tables can be assessed by calculating kappa, as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>SS</td><td>SC</td><td>CS</td><td>CC</td><td>kappa</td><td>% agree</td></tr><tr><td>1 v 2</td><td>3520</td><td>280</td><td>123</td><td>216</td><td>0.46</td><td>97%</td></tr><tr><td>1 v 3</td><td>2182</td><td>1348</td><td>43</td><td>296</td><td>0.18</td><td>64%</td></tr><tr><td>2 v 3</td><td>2164</td><td>1209</td><td>61</td><td>435</td><td>0.26</td><td>67%</td></tr></table>

Also shown is the percentage agreement. Thus the best agreement is between dentists 1 and 2. Dentist 3 considered that there were many more carious teeth (1644) than the other two observers (339 and 496). (b) A kappa value of 0.46 is not usually considered to be especially good agreement, but dentists 1 and 2 agreed about  $97\%$  of the teeth examined. This discrepancy is because they both considered the large majority of teeth to be sound. Among the 619 teeth which at least one of dentists 1 and 2 considered carious, they agreed on only  $216$ $(35\%)$ . Good agreement depends upon circumstances, not upon the kappa value (and certainly not upon the P value - because of the huge sample size, all the above kappa values are highly statistically significant).

## CHAPTER 15

15.1 Differences in baseline values in the treatment groups for variables which might affect patient prognosis could affect the result of the trial. It is the magnitude of the imbalance that is important - statistical significance is irrelevant. In Table 3.5, the differences are trivial except perhaps for pain at presentation. As pain score was also the outcome measure for the trial this imbalance could be important. It may therefore be reasonable to analyse the change in pain from baseline rather than the value at the end of the study. (In fact, in this study the authors noted that the baseline pain score was not prognostic.) When there is imbalance in a variable for which the prognostic value is unknown, the outcome can be examined in relation to the values of that variable for each treatment group. Imbalance in a prognostic variable is handled by adjusting the comparison of treatment groups using regression analysis, see section 15.4.

15.2 (a) Only those allocated alprenolol would have been withdrawn because of contraindication for the beta- blocker. The two groups, apart from being of unequal size, would thus have been non- comparable, and the trial results would be unsound.

(b) No.

(c) By not allocating treatments (randomizing) until immediately before starting treatment.

15.3 (a) This was an uncontrolled trial, which is not a proper way to evaluate a treatment. Another very poor feature of this study was that the study was 'open', so that the patients knew when they were taking aspirin. Further, the study was extremely small, especially bearing in mind that the measurements were highly variable.

(b) The standard deviations are obtained as  $\mathrm{SE} \times \sqrt{13}$ , or 36.1, 26.7 and 19.8 for the three sets of observations. The data are thus skewed, especially before treatment, because the SD is more than half the mean.

(c) The paper gives no indication about how the data were analysed (if at all). An appropriate analysis would be a paired Wilcoxon test to compare any two sets of data, or a paired  $t$  test if the differences were reasonably Normal. Two way analysis of variance could be used to compare all three groups simultaneously. As noted, however, these analyses would be of limited value because there was no comparison group.

(d) The mean and SD (or SE) of the within-subject changes would be valuable, as would a CI for the changes.

(e) For the reasons already given, the design of this study was inappropriate to answer the question. The data do in fact show some improvement, although it is implied that this was not statistically

significant. Confidence intervals would be very wide. It is totally wrong to suggest that on the basis of this small study the possibility of an effect of aspirin can be excluded.

15.4 (a) Paired  $t$  tests for the two groups give  $t = 4.23$  (on 8 df;  $\mathbf{P} = 0.003$ ) and  $t = 1.58$  (on 6 df;  $\mathbf{P} = 0.17$ ). The highly significant changes in one group only may suggest that there is indeed a difference between the groups. However, these are within group analyses whereas the whole point of a clinical trial is to compare the groups directly. We should do this using a two sample  $t$  test on the values after one week of treatment or on the changes in systolic blood pressure, not via an indirect comparison of  $\mathbf{P}$  values from independent analyses. The authors' interpretation is not valid.

(b) The means (SD) of the changes for the two groups are 12.67 (8.99) and 4.71 (7.91) respectively, and the  $t$  test gives  $t = 1.85$  (14 df;  $\mathbf{P} = 0.09$ ). (Likewise, a comparison of the one week blood pressures gives  $t = 1.65$  (14 df;  $\mathbf{P} = 0.12$ ).) There is thus some weak evidence that the groups may differ - the conclusion drawn by the authors is not supported by a correct analysis.

15.5 (a) As described in section 15.3, the standardized difference here is

$$
\frac{0.3 - 0.2}{\sqrt{0.25 \times 0.75}} = 0.23.
$$

Using the nomogram in Figure 15.2, the required sample size is 600 (300 per group).

(b) About  $15\%$ .

(c) A standardized difference of 0.7 gives  $80\%$  power with a sample of size 65. Taking the risk of hypertension in the placebo group as 0.3, we have

$$
\frac{0.3 - p_{\mathrm{a}}}{\sqrt{\bar{p}(1 - \bar{p})}} = 0.7
$$

where  $p_{\mathrm{a}}$  is the proportion developing hypertension in the aspirin group and  $\bar{p}$  is the average of 0.3 and  $p_{\mathrm{a}}$ . This equation can be solved mathematically or by trial and error; the answer is  $p_{\mathrm{a}} = 0.04$ . The trial was clearly too small to have a good chance of detecting all but a very large benefit of treatment.

(d) The Chi squared test with Yates' correction gives  $X^{2} = 3.89$  ( $\mathbf{P} = 0.049$ ). The  $\mathbf{P}$  value quoted is one-sided, although there is no comment to that effect in the paper. The result is thus only marginally significant. The RR of 0.33 has a very wide  $95\%$  CI from 0.12 to 0.93. The authors are right to interpret their findings cautiously, and to suggest that a larger trial would be needed to confirm (or not) the benefit of aspirin in this setting.

## CHAPTER 16

16.1 The  $\mathbf{P}$  value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. It does not indicate the magnitude of the observed effect. Two clinical trials of different sizes may yield the same treatment effect but different  $\mathbf{P}$  values. For continuous variables the  $\mathbf{P}$  value also depends upon the variability (see exercise 9.6).

16.2 If we do not consider 'identical' to refer to sample size, then one reason could be variation in the numbers of patients studied. Two identical studies of the same size would not be expected to yield exactly the same results. The observed effects (and  $\mathbf{P}$  values) would tend to be closer if the studies were large than if they were small. Dramatically different results for large studies may mean that the studies were not as 'identical' as claimed. For example, there may be differences between patients in different countries or between laboratories.

16.3 (a) Assuming a Normal distribution, the average height of men can be expressed as (179.1 - 171.7)/5.75 standard deviations above the mean height of women. This value is 1.287. From Table B1 the upper tail areas corresponding to standard Normal deviates of 1.25 and 1.30 are 0.1056 and 0.0968, so the required value is 0.10 or  $10\%$ .

(b) The probability of a man being taller than  $182.9\mathrm{~cm}$  is the upper tail area of the Normal distribution corresponding to  $z = (182.9 - 179.1) / 5.84 = 0.65$ , which from Table B1 is 0.2578. For women we require the tail area corresponding to  $z = (182.9 - 171.7) / 5.75 = 1.95$ , which is 0.0256. If  $60\%$  of adults are women the proportion of adults taller than  $182.9\mathrm{~cm}$  who are women is given by

$$
\frac{0.6 \times 0.0256}{0.4 \times 0.2578 + 0.6 \times 0.0256}
$$

$= 0.1296$  or  $13\%$ .

16.4 The age- structure of the population has changed markedly, with the proportion of older people being much higher than it was. The total death rate, which is calculated by multiplying the age- specific rates and the numbers at risk, is unchanged because the age- specific reductions in rates are counterbalanced by the greater numbers of elderly people.

16.5 (a) No, because the figures are percentages. Although it is a method of comparing proportions (or percentages) the Chi squared test must be performed on frequencies.

(b) The percentages are  $73 / 457 = 16.0\%$  and  $138 / 370 = 37.3\%$ , so the difference is  $21\%$ . The  $95\%$  confidence interval is  $15\%$  to  $27\%$ . Because the sample is large the interval is quite narrow.

(c) The simplest way to assess a trend is to use the Chi squared test for trend. It is reasonable to give equally spaced scores to the three social class groups (such as  $-1$ , 0 and 1). Those children whose social class was unclassified must be excluded. The proportions being compared were shown at the beginning of the problem. The Chi squared tests give  $X_{\text{trend}}^{2} = 3.64 \quad (\mathbf{P} = 0.06)$  and  $X_{\text{trend}}^{2} = 7.69$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.006)$ .

(d) Although the trend is significant (at the  $5\%$  level) in one group but not the other, we should not infer that the relation is present only within the non-fluoridated area. The simplest way to compare the trends is to use the regression approach to estimate the change in  $\%$  dmft for each change in social class category (section 11.15.2) and compare the slopes (section 11.12.1). Alternatively, all the data could be analysed at once in a complicated logistic regression analysis.

(e) The technical term for such a heterogeneity of effect is 'interaction'.

16.6 (a) A graph of the differences between the indirect and direct measurements against their average shows no tendency for the differences to be related to the level of blood pressure. The mean and SD of differences were  $-4.80$  and 12.46 respectively, so  $95\%$  limits of agreement are  $-29.72$  to  $20.12 \mathrm{mmHg}$ .

(b) The values  $-10$  and  $+10$  are respectively  $-0.42$  and 1.18 SDs from the mean. Assuming that the differences come from a Normal population, the probability of a difference larger than 10 in either direction is the probability of being less than  $-10$  plus the probability of being greater than 10, which (from Table B1) is  $0.3372 + 0.1190 = 0.4562$ , or about  $46\%$ . Alternatively, we can take the observed proportion as an estimate, which is  $22 / 50 = 0.44$  or  $44\%$ . (This method is less reliable when the differences are Normal.)

(c) Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.32  $(\mathbf{P}< 0.01)$  with weight, 0.18  $(\mathbf{P} > 0.10)$  with arm circumference and  $-0.24 (\mathbf{P} > 0.05)$  with age. There is thus some evidence that the discrepancy between the direct and indirect measurements increases with body weight. The slope of the regression line is 0.394  $(\mathbf{SE} = 0.167)$ , indicating an estimated increase in the difference between the methods of  $4 \mathrm{mmHg}$  per  $10 \mathrm{kg}$  additional body weight.

(d) It could be due to a 'learning effect' with the new direct method of measurement. The rank correlation between the differences and the order of measurement is 0.37  $(\mathbf{P}< 0.01)$ .

(e) The Mean and SD of the differences between the measurements from the last 40 women are  $-2.93$  and  $11.47 \mathrm{mmHg}$ , so that the  $95\%$  limits of agreement are  $-25.87$  and 20.01. These limits are not much narrower than those derived using the data from all 50 women.

16.7 (a) The data for the three days can be examined by a two way

analysis of variance. The means and SDs for the three days are:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Day 1</td><td>151.27</td><td>62.37</td></tr><tr><td>Day 2</td><td>194.40</td><td>78.77</td></tr><tr><td>Day 3</td><td>111.47</td><td>61.14</td></tr></table>

As the SDs are similar it is likely that the assumptions for a parametric analysis will be met, but the residuals should be checked after fitting the model. The comparison of the three times within the analysis of variance gives  $F = 7.24$  on 2 and 28 degrees of freedom  $(\mathbf{P} = 0.003)$ . The Shapiro- Francia  $W^{\prime}$  test of the residuals from this model gives  $W^{\prime} = 0.992$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.97)$ , showing that the residuals have a distribution very close to Normal.

As there is highly significant variation among the days it is reasonable to examine each pair of days using  $t$  tests with the SE based on the residual SD from the analysis of variance (which is 59.7175 mmol/l). These tests give:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Difference</td><td>t</td><td>P</td><td>P*</td></tr><tr><td>Day 1 v Day 2</td><td>43.13</td><td>1.98</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.17</td></tr><tr><td>Day 1 v Day 3</td><td>-39.80</td><td>-1.82</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Day 2 v Day 3</td><td>-82.93</td><td>-3.80</td><td>0.0007</td><td>0.002</td></tr></table>

where  $\mathbf{P}^{*}$  is  $\mathbf{P}$  multiplied by 3 (the Bonferroni adjustment). Days 2 and 3 are highly significantly different, even after the Bonferroni correction. The other differences are not significant, but the mean changes in plasma aldosterone are quite large.

(b) The residual SD should also be used to construct a CI for the difference between any pair of means. The  $95\%$  CI for the difference between the means on days 1 and 2 is given by  $43.13 \pm 2.048 \times 59.7175 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{13} + \frac{1}{13}}$ , or  $-1.53$  to  $87.79 \mathrm{mmol / l}$ . This wide CI suggests that there may well be a real change in plasma aldosterone associated with a rapid change from low to high altitude, but a larger study would be needed to investigate this possibility.

(c) The correlation coefficient between the mountain sickness score (AMS) and the change in plasma aldosterone is  $-0.36$ $(\mathbf{P} = 0.19)$ . There is little evidence that the two variables are related.

16.8 No, this is not a reasonable argument. It is true that the confidence interval will be wide. This is not meaningless, but rather indicates that the study was too small to enable precise conclusions to be drawn.
